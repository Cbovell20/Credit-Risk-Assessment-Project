# Credit-Risk-Assessment-Project

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict credit risk for borrowers based on their financial and demographic data. The model will be built using historical data on loan applications and their outcomes, and will be evaluated on its ability to correctly predict the risk of default for new loan applications
